    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is my website, making it happen.</p>
    <p>HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup language that defines
        the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, 
        which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to 
        make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags 
        can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize 
        words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. </p>
